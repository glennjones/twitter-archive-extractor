## Twitter Archive Extractor

__This is a 9-year-old historical project - It is left up as an archive.__

The module parses a twitter archive file and creates JSON using microformat schemas. Creates individual strurctures such as notes, checkina and photos etc. The text is converted into HTML, by automatically linking the URLs and twitter elements such as username and hashtags.
